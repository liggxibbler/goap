GOAP
========================================

	GOAP is an AI technique used in the F.E.A.R. series of games in order
to enable its agents to hunt down and kill the player character! This project,
however, tries to use it to make stories, i.e. sequences of interesting events.
The code was developed as part of my MSc dissertation at Abertay University.

What's the plan?
========================================

	It never felt quite complete to me, and I've been meaning to get some
more work done; e.g. sort out a few bugs, refactor some really badly implemented
features, and perhaps add a few new features!
